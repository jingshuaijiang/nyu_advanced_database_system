// Test 2
//
// Main Test Idea:
// ---------------
// - Test that when a TX tries to get a lock at a failed site which hasn't
//   been down for 3 time steps, and thus that the TM has yet to mark as down,
//   the TX tries to get a lock on that site for the variable and eventually
//   fails, either at commit time or via a timeout.
//

// If the R(T1,x2) went to site 2 then T1 should fail. Otherwise it
// should succeed.

begin(T1)
begin(T2)
dump()
R(T1,x2)		// Should read from site 1
R(T2,x3)		// Should read from site 4
fail(2)
W(T1,x2,2)		// Should succeed
W(T2,x3,3)		// Should succeed
R(T2,x5)		// Should read from site 6
W(T2,x5,5)		// Should succeed
R(T2,x7)		// Should read from site 8
W(T2,x7,7)		// Should succeed
end(T1)			// Should succeed
dump()
end(T2)			// Should succeed
