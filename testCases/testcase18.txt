// Test script #1
// Purpose: test transactions and the wait-die protocol in the absence of failures
// I'll test:
// 1. Regular lock / unlock mechanisms and read / write mechanims
// 2. An older transaction waiting for a younger transaction to finish
// 3. A younger transaction aborted because of the wait-die (cannot wait for conflicting older transaction)
// 4. MVCC operations

// items 1,2,3
begin(T1)
R(T1,x2)	// T1 reads x2 from site 1
R(T1,x1)	// T1 reads x1 from site 2
W(T1, x2, 10)	// T1 writes x2 to all sites
R(T1, x2)	// make sure a transaction reads the last value it has written if it did the last write on a data item
dump()

W(T3, x4, 100)	// T3 writes x4 to all sites

R(T2, x5)	// should wait for T3 to finish
